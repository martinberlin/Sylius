        about_us_content: 'Slosarek is a Berlin-based design startup founded in early 2018. Paula, the main creator, is a polish architect who since her early age was inspired by the rough, urban beauty.

                           After over 10 years of experience in architecture, she decided to devote herself to design and transmit the soul of a big city into everyday items.

                           Her forms made of concrete are inspired by the modernist approach to creating, making the urban style, functionality, and elegance in simplicity the main assets of slosarek.eu.'
